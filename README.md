# accelerometer-fft
fft of accelerometer data

# How to compile and run?
Fist clone and initalize the submodule
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/jpvolt/accelerometer-fft```
Just compile with g++, the only dependency is a header only lib(added as submodule).
```g++ main.cpp```
Running will generate a output.txt file.
